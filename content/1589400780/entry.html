    <p>In a way this allows the compiler to do more work because you cannot use the
    function if you cannot get to the stronger type of the argument.</p>
    
    <p>As opposed to the developer doing more work handling the potential weaker
    states of the result.</p>

    <p>&rdquo;&hellip; a refinement of the input type that preserves the knowledge gained in the type system.
    Both of these functions check the same thing, but [&hellip;] gives the caller access to the
    information it learned, while [&hellip;] just throws it away.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Parsing is a transformation and that transformation can add information gained
    during the process yielding a stronger resulting type.</p>
    
    <p>Validation yields a point-in-time exception (or not) after which the validated
    type is no more meaningful than before &ndash; and is just as capable of containing
    an invalid value as a valid value.</p>
