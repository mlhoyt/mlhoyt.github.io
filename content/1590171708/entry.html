    <ul>
    <li>Uses a light framework that allows for changes.
    
    <ul>
    <li>As opposed to a big up-front design which is supposed to have accounted
    for all potential concerns / functionality.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Small commands are made to prevent from losing the element of extensibility</li>
    <li>Following the principle of separating work elements into comprehensible units</li>
    <li>Avoid &hellip; low cohesion and high coupling
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Cohesion</strong>: the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together
    In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the
    class&rsquo;s methods and data themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Coupling</strong>: is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a
    measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are.</li>
    </ul></li>
