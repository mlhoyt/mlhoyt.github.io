## [Wikipedia: extensibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility)

- Uses a light framework that allows for changes.
  - As opposed to a big up-front design which is supposed to have accounted
    for all potential concerns / functionality.
- Small commands are made to prevent from losing the element of extensibility
- Following the principle of separating work elements into comprehensible units
- Avoid ... low cohesion and high coupling 
  - **Cohesion**: the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together
    In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the
    class's methods and data themselves.
  - **Coupling**: is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a
    measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are.
